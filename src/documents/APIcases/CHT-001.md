# Test Design: *CHT-001*

## Test Design Inputs

### Requirements

CHT-01 Chatty social network allows to update the information about an existing user

## Test Procedure

### Test Setup

```gherkin
Given Autotest Framework is launched
And user server base URI: "http://chatty.telran-edu.de:8989" is set
And new user with random <email>, <password>, and <role> is created
And new user is added to server via Post http method (endpoint "/api/auth/register", body)
And added user username is returned
And user is updated via Post http method (endpoint "/api/users/{id}", body)
And new random <avatarUrl>, <name>, <surname>, <birthDate>, <phone>, <gender>, <backgroundUrl> and <blocked> are created
```

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario Positive:
**CHT-01-1** Verify user can be updated by user id
```gherkin
Given initial setup
When Autotest Framework updates user via Post http method (endpoint "api/users/" + id, id
in path) from server
Then server returns updated user information
And  Autotest Framework compares information about created in precondition user and
returned user by id from precondition. Assert they're equal
```

### Test Clean Up
Given test scenario is completed
When Autotest Framework deletes added user via Delete http method, endpoint "/users/" + id,
accessToken in header "Authorization=Bearer"
Then user is deleted
